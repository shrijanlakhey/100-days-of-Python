# when to use while or for loop?
# use for loops when you have to iterate over something and need to do something with each thing you are iterating over
# use while loop when you dont care what number in a sqeuence you are in, which item you are iterating through in a list and want to carry out ceratin functionality as many times as required until the condition set is satisfied
